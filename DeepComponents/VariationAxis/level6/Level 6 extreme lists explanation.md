# DC in level 6:

## 口一艹日土十山冖王田目罒車丨皿工止⻗⺊士匚丰革堇干彐覀龶中由非臣𠃍且廿甲回㠯里𫝀肀曲世占凵出聿直甘𠃊屮巨五申卌丑亞華畢𦣞毌𠃑囬𠁁凹亜コ

## Concept of level 6

- DC only contains strokes as "一" (horizontal stroke) and "丨" (vertical stroke) and their combined strokes (eg."𠃊") 

*This level grouping only applies to DCs' basic shapes, some of other versions of these DCs may contain curve strokes

- Easy to make the extremes for cover all the situations

## Concept of this list

- Show extreme exemples

- Real DC axis will be more extreme than the characters shown in this list, because the real extremes are difficult to grasp
    
    - There are many characters can be the extremes for a same case, it depends on design.

    - It's hard to determine the actual situation (size, thickness) when combine a character. It depends on the size and the thickness of other DCs in the actual chracter
    
    - All we have to do is make sure that all possible situations are covered

### "口" as exemple

- Master: A full-width square without bottom foots)

- Axis "X_X_na": a naroww square (narrow than the case show in the extreme list 唧)

- Axis "X_X_fl": a flat square (narrow than the case show in the extreme list 籯)

- Axis "B_S_2l": a square with 2 foots on bottom 圞 )

- Axis "BL_S_lo": a square with only right foot on bottom 㕴)

## Level 6 extreme list will show:

- Necessary axis with instructions (axis name)

- Some characters who can be extremes show where the changes are

- Will not make single groups if more than 3 changes and all the axis necessary are already exist in other groups

- Will not make groups for all the characters because most of them use 3+ axis and hard to defined when not in the design step
